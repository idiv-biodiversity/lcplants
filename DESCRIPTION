Description: Allows taxonomic resolution of plant taxa names listed in the 
"Leipzig Catalogue of Vascular Plants" (LCVP). The package aims to facilitate 
finding, retrieving and orthographically resolving plant names through the 
comparison between plant taxa. The R-package is able to apply a text-based 
search of plant names on the LCVP using a fuzzy match algorithm, which is the 
core of the searching engine. This package interacts with data available trough the 
"LCVP" package, which is available in a github repository. To access this data package, run 
'devtools::install_github("idiv-biodiversity/LCVP")'. The size of the `LCVP` package
is approximately 45 MB.
